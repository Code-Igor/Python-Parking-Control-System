# Python-Parking-Control-System
 
This is a project I did in Python, using the NumPy library and a dictionary. It consists of a parking control system where there are 3 sectors (A, B and C) with 5 spaces for each sector. The code is separated into 4 main functions that configure the parking management: ocupar_vaga, which occupies a random space (this function is random because it simulates a random vehicle that parked); liberar_vaga, which frees up a space chosen by the user; exibir_vaga, which displays all free spaces in the parking lot; consultar_veiculo, which allows the user to consult a parked vehicle.
